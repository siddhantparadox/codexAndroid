# UX

## v1 principles

- Fast access to pairing, connection status, and active thread.
- Streaming-first interface for plan, tool calls, command output, and diffs.
- High-friction actions (approvals) use explicit, contextual confirmation.

## Current status

- UX scaffolding started.
- Detailed component hierarchy and motion system will be added as mobile UI implementation progresses.
